- Content caching.

- FastCGI timeout/redirect

- TLS

- Optimize file/cache serving performance

- Access control infrastructure

- Add WITNESS_WARN(WARN_GIANTOK | WARN_SLEEPOK, ...) to appropriate functions;

- Move khttpd_ctrl_parse_json to khttpd_webapi and rename it.

- Currently, khttpd_file_get_exchange_get() limits io_size to MAXPHYS.
  See whether this is necessary or not.

- bug: FastCGI reconfiguration (PUT to fastcgi location resource) crashes the kernel.

- the kernel should restrict the time waiting the client to close the
  connection after it sends a response with 'Connection: close' (nginx's
  lingering_timeout feature).

- configuration dump/restore API

- Server configuration UI

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware

- Atomic server reconfiguration.
