- Caching

- FastCGI timeout/redirect

- TLS

- Optimize file/cache serving performance

- Access control infrastructure

- Add WITNESS_WARN(WARN_GIANTOK | WARN_SLEEPOK, ...) to appropriate functions;

- Currently, khttpd_file_get_exchange_get() limits io_size to MAXPHYS.
  See whether this is necessary or not.

  lingering_timeout feature).

- configuration dump/restore API

- Server configuration UI

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware

- Atomic server reconfiguration.
