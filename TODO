- Add support for basic authentication

- Access control infrastructure

- TLS

- Optimize file/cache serving performance

- Add WITNESS_WARN(WARN_GIANTOK | WARN_SLEEPOK, ...) to appropriate functions;

- Move khttpd_ctrl_parse_json to khttpd_webapi and rename it.

- struct khttpd_exchange_ops::end should be renamed.  'end' is not the end of
  the exchange, but the request.  This is difficult to know from the name.

- Currently, khttpd_file_get_exchange_get() limits io_size to MAXPHYS.
  See whether this is necessary or not.

- Optimize the setting of SO_SNDLOWAT value.

- More scalable object lifecycle management than reference counting.

- See whether running jobs of khttpd_file on the same CPU as the caller of
  khttpd_file_get performs better than random CPU assignment.

- the kernel should restrict the time waiting the client to close the
  connection after it sends a response with 'Connection: close' (nginx's
  lingering_timeout feature).

- configuration dump/restore API

- Server configuration UI

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware

- Atomic server reconfiguration.
