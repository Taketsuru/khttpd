- Utilize nitems macro defined in <sys/param.h>.

- ktr flushing should be stopped if write or fdatasync fails.

- Move and rename khttpd_ctrl_parse_json to khttpd_webapi.

- Add WITNESS_WARN(WARN_GIANTOK | WARN_SLEEPOK, ...) to appropriate functions;

- struct khttpd_exchange_ops::{get,put,end} should be renamed.  'end' is not
  the end of the exchange, but the request.  This is difficult to know from the
  name.  Also the meaning of 'get' and 'put' are easily misunderstood as
  opposit.

- Add support for basic authentication

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware

- configuration dump/restore API

- Server configuration UI

- TLS

- CGI etc.

- Optimize file/cache serving performance

- Currently, khttpd_file_get_exchange_get() limits io_size to MAXPHYS.
  See whether this is necessary or not.

- Optimize the setting of SO_SNDLOWAT value.

- the kernel should restrict the time waiting the client to close the
  connection after it sends a response with 'Connection: close' (nginx's
  lingering_timeout feature).

- Set SO_LINGER option with timeout = 0 when the server aborts a connection.

- More scalable object lifecycle management than reference counting.

- See whether running jobs of khttpd_file on the same CPU as the caller of
  khttpd_file_get performs better than random CPU assignment.

- Atomic server reconfiguration.
