- Implement tests http_host_field_no_port_ok,
  http_host_field_no_port_reject, http_host_field_with_port_ok, and
  http_host_field_with_port_reject.

- BUG: specifing invalid path to errorLog crashes the kernel

- More functional tests

- Feature to redirect accesses

- FastCGI timeout/redirect

- Support range requests for khttpd_file locations.

- Last-Modified: and ETag: for khttpd_file location.

- Caching

- TLS

- Optimize file/cache serving performance

- Access control infrastructure

- BUG: FastCGI reconfiguration (PUT to fastcgi location resource) crashes
  the kernel.

- the kernel should restrict the time waiting the client to close the
  connection after it sends a response with 'Connection: close' (nginx's
  lingering_timeout feature).

- configuration dump/restore API

- Server configuration UI

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware

- Atomic server reconfiguration.
    - Log construction functions should be redesigned.

- Add configuration parameter 'translucent' to khttpd_file location handler.

- BUG: closing a socket just after sending a request that targeted to a
  resource served by a fastcgi server doesn't abort the request sent to
  the fastcgi server.  This is because khttpd doesn't monitor the http
  socket in the interval from the arrival of a request till the sending of
  the response.
