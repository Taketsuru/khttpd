- struct khttpd_exchange_ops::{get,put,end} should be renamed.  'end' is not
  the end of the exchange, but the request.  This is difficult to know from the
  name.  Also the meaning of 'get' and 'put' are easily misunderstood as
  opposit.

- Creating a location whose name is identical to an existing location should
  shadow the existing location.  This is to prevent a slow releasing of a
  location from affecting the re-initialization of the server.

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware.

- More scalable object lifecycle management than reference counting.
