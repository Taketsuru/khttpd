- give a name to each khttpd_log and use it to log errors in the log writer.

- ktr flushing should be stopped if write or fdatasync fails.

- khttpd_job_schedule should not sleep because it's called by callout handlers.

- Move and rename khttpd_ctrl_parse_json to khttpd_webapi.

- Merge overhaul_1 to master.

- Add WITNESS_WARN(WARN_GIANTOK | WARN_SLEEPOK, ...) to appropriate functions;

- struct khttpd_exchange_ops::{get,put,end} should be renamed.  'end' is not
  the end of the exchange, but the request.  This is difficult to know from the
  name.  Also the meaning of 'get' and 'put' are easily misunderstood as
  opposit.

- Rewrite khttpd_file so that the file descriptor of the stream is not
  necessary.

- Add support for basic authentication

- make khttpd_test multi-module aware

- configuration dump/restore API

- Server configuration UI

- TLS

- CGI etc.

- More scalable object lifecycle management than reference counting.

- Optimize file/cache serving performance

- Servers should have two locations trees.  One is effective tree and the
  other is the target of various update.  The effective tree should be
  rewritten (swapped) by the other tree atomically.  In-fligh sessions
  should not be affected by the udpate.

- (obsolete) Creating a location whose name is identical to an existing
  location should shadow the existing location.  This is to prevent a slow
  releasing of a location from affecting the re-initialization of the
  server.
